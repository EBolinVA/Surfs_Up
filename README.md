# Surfs_Up
I love surfing and milkshakes! This is a Business Plan Analysis for a surf &amp; shake shack to be built in Hawaii, analyzing weather using SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask database structures and querying methods. Python code is written and executed in a Jupyter notebook and graphs are created using Python.

In order to secure funding, I'll provide the investor with insight into the weather patterns of a specific location on Oahu where I want to build my shop. I'll provide visualization by plotting the results of the precipitation analysis using Matplotlib.
